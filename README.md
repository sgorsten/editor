Overview
========

This project consists of some very early explorations into a 3D scene editor, of the sort that might be used to author video game levels, etc. Currently, we have a more-or-less working text entry widget, and the ability to compose cleanly resizeable GUIs using it. Our example program simply allows the user to move a square around the screen by inputting data into a property map.
