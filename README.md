Overview
========

This project consists of some very early explorations into a 3D scene editor, of the sort that might be used to author video game levels, etc.

Our example program shows a view into a 3D scene, with the ability to select objects either by clicking or by picking them from an object list, and with the ability to modify some properties either via a gizmo or through a property editor.
